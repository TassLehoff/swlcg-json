# Star Wars LCG JSON

The purpose of this project is provide a community driven card database for the Star Wars LCG card game from Fantasy Flight Games.

The initial creation of this database is from the Star Wars LCG OCTGN sets catalog. Most of the information is verbatim, however, there were some tweaks that were made to some fields.

## Documentation

More to come...

In the mean time, view the ```/json``` directory.

## TODO

* Parse any keyword reminder text and associate with that keyword. An examle would be a Pilot keyword that has text to define it's abilities when played as a Pilot.
* Add illustrator field.
* Flag cards as enhancement when the card type is an enhancement, keyword of Pilot, or the text states the card can be played as enhancement.
* Add aggregated objective set metrics to each objective card.
